##Elasticsearch Employee Data Indexing
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for setting up and interacting with an Elasticsearch instance to manage employee data. The notebook demonstrates the use of Python with the elasticsearch library to connect, create indices, and index data in an Elasticsearch cluster.

Features
Setup and Configuration:
Install necessary dependencies (pandas, elasticsearch).
Connect to an Elasticsearch instance.
Data Handling:
Load and preprocess employee data from CSV.
Define Elasticsearch index mappings.
Indexing:
Index the employee data with custom mappings into Elasticsearch.
Search and retrieve indexed data using Elasticsearch queries.
Requirements
To run this notebook, you need:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Elasticsearch (8.x or later)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elasticsearch-employee-data.git
cd elasticsearch-employee-data
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have a running Elasticsearch instance. If you don't, you can run one locally using Docker:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 9200:9200 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:8.7.0
Usage
Open the notebook in Jupyter:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Elasticsearch.ipynb
Execute the cells step-by-step:

Install necessary Python packages.
Connect to your Elasticsearch instance.
Load the employee dataset and process it.
Create the index with the defined mappings.
Index the data and interact with it using Elasticsearch queries.
Example Data
The notebook uses sample employee data from Employee Sample Data 1.csv, which includes fields like:

Employee ID
Full Name
Job Title
Department
Gender
Hire Date
Annual Salary
Elasticsearch Mapping
A custom mapping is defined for the employee data, which includes fields such as employee_id, full_name, job_title, and hire_date, with appropriate data types for indexing in Elasticsearch.
